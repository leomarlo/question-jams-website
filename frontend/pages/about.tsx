        <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        <span className="bold-first-word">Questions</span> are a curious thing. Whenever we are being asked a question it appears that a particular part of our mind awakens. Maybe the one that feels obliged to answer. Maybe the one that finds a solution to a problem. The tension of a question seeks to be released through an answer in much the same way that a dominant seeks to be resolved in a tonic. What about leaving a question unanswered? Is it impolite? Is it subversive? This asymmetry between the question and an answer, between the questioner and the questionee has so much tension and energy that it is an integral part of the two main moving forces of our societies, namely power and knowledge. Both appear to be mediated through questions. In this research project we would like to explore the dynamics of questions through question jams. As the name suggests these are experimental improvisations with questions.

      <p>
        <span className="bold-first-word">We</span>  would like to explore the intricacies, the absurdities, the harmonies and disharmonies  that appear in the act of asking and being asked. To this end we will proceed in four steps: First we derive material from existing interviews, literature, daily scenarios and television series gathered mainly from Switzerland, Norway, Denmark and Austria and their respective cultural spheres. Second, we develop improvisations around the material. These sessions can either be zoom sessions, face-to-face or in a public place. They can be amongst project participants, pedestrians or encounters. Third, we then dive into phenomena that appear during the sessions and iterate them. Finally, this output material is then used as input for performances that combine voice, movement and other media as well as concepts from moral and behaviour theory. Here we draw on the ideas of Søren Aabye Kierkegaard about subjective truths. We intend to visit his monument in the Royal Library Garden in Copenhagen and interrogate it. We also intend to parse some his work “Either Or” using a python script and draw from the questions therein. Another source of inspiration is the “Fragebogen” by Max Frisch, who explores the depth of our experience through a sequence of questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span className="bold-first-word">As</span> part of the performative output, we intend to travel to public spaces and initiate question jams and show question performances. We also work with a composer who uses his compositional concepts to engage with the peculiarities, such as the expectations and the resolutions present in the jams. Finally, we also want to arrange the output as a compendium of questions. Each highlighting a certain aspect of the experience landscape in the question jams. We believe that the project will provide a contribution to a critical mindset and an awareness of power structures inherent in this peculiar part of our language, i.e. questions. In the larger scope that extends to the further future we would like to bring the “Question” back into focus as a mediator for critical thinking but also a signifier and vector of social roles. This objective is achieved through an experimental approach that seeks to explore the experiential dimension of what happens to us when we question. The diverse cultural backgrounds of our participants, namely Switzerland, Norway, China and Germany provide a further aspect that allows us to play with societal expectations and models and provides us with an outside perspective.

        <h2>Our Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
            <span className="bold-first-word">Our</span> core team consists of the performance artist, vocal improvisor, eurhythmician Li, the physicist and artistic researcher Dr. Horstmeyer and the composer Tvedten. Whilst we have collaborated in pairs, we have never collaborated together, yet we share a fascination for questions that draw us together beyond our disciplinary confines and our cultural backgrounds. The material acquisition, conception and technical work is done mostly by Dr. Horstmeyer, drawing on his knowledge rooted in physics and philosophy. The conception of the media settings and improvisations is created by Li. She also creates concepts for the performative output. Tvedten is translating the experiential dimension into compositional elements. We are inspired by our respective expertises, our ability to commit and to take responsibility shown in former collaborations.
